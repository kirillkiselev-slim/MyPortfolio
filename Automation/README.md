# Portfolio - Minor projects

## Overview:

These are minor projects that I personally created
to automate some of the tasks that I had been working on 
while my time at Gold Apple LLC. 

Note: The scripts are not completely coded 
by standardized design and style, all of them are still being modified and optimized

Some of these include:
* scraping our backend info about metas and retrieving that info into an Excel file (the filenames is "magaScrapeBLR.py")
* automating the task where script fills out the form and inserts specified files, (the filename is "PriceRuleAutomation.py") 

#### The modules used:
* selenium
* time 
* csv
* os
* re
* pytz
* Path
* datetime
* openpyxl
