#### Description: 
I have used Django as framework, which I am still learning and developing new skills.
The web-application has multiple purposes for a user 
to exploit. User either logins with their username and password, 
or signs up entering their new username, email and password.
Then, they are redirected to the form to select their country, after submitting and saving it to the database - all countries of users are shown on the world map with markers and usernames. CSV file is used with all countrys', their longitude and latitude.
User can also choose their exact city by clicking on the field in the navbar. By typing in the city, my app uses API to check if the city exists and entered correctly. After providing the city, 
it renders the page with all usernames, their current weather, listed from highest to lowest.
The app is designed for my friends and relatives who live across the whole globe, to share their weather and location.
